# 361

Hello, this is my README file. Test one two three...

For this project, each student has free reign to create a prototype of an application. Working on a full-scale project independently is a huge milestone for me. IST 361 gives me the freedom and flexibility to experience the entire development lifecycle from conception to working prototype, along with all of the challenges that I will face in the real world.

I decided to design a prototype for a textbook price match application. The idea came to me at the beginning of the semester when I was trying to find the best places to order textbooks. 

Below is a list of all of the classes in the project and a quick summary of what they do:

Book - Creates an object of type Book, where information is stored about each book in the system.
BookList - Contains a list of books. Future updates may see this stored in a database instead.

LoginC - Controls the login, which entails authenticating users against the UserList.

It is also worth noting that there is a PersistentData class and an accompanying controller. That functionality is under construction.
